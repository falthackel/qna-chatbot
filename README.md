## Study Case
You are provided with a dataset comprising 3.4 million Google Store reviews for a music streaming application (e.g., Spotify) sourced from various users. The management is currently facing difficulties in extracting actionable insights from these reviews due to their unstructured nature and the sheer volume of data. Manual handling has proven to be time-consuming, and a more efficient solution is required to address management queries in a timely manner.

## Tasks
As an AI engineer at our company, your task is to develop an internal Q&A tool capable of extracting meaningful information from the Google Store reviews dataset ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_xaRB6d2K_9-1dUmdU0GjtaqPO7uQnTM/view)) for the music streaming application (Spotify, [source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bwandowando/3-4-million-spotify-google-store-reviews/)). The tool should provide insightful responses to a variety of management questions.
